# Tech-Blog Web App

  ## Description
Welcome to my CMS-style blog site! Here, you can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Explore existing blog posts on the homepage, navigate through the site, leave comments, and enjoy a seamless user experience with secure authentication and a user-friendly dashboard. This project is still a work in progress, which will be fleshed out over time.

## Reference
For this project, I would credit [Christian McIlvenny](https://github.com/TDGNate/Tech-Blog) and [Muhammad Moghul](https://github.com/mmoghal/tech-blog/tree/main) for their own projects, from which I drew some inspiration; though I did my best to keep it as original as I could think to, and to best learn the code.
